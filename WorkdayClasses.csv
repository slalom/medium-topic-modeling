Coaching Habit,"Coaching can help our people to perform at their best, learn from their own experiences, and drive empowerment and engagement. Yet, we regularly fall back on old habits of telling instead of asking, mentoring instead of coaching, and directing instead of leading. In this class, we’ll delineate the difference between mentoring and coaching, introduce a simple frameworks for a 10 minutes coaching conversation, and establish a new habit to reinforce regular coaching conversations with your team. At the end of this course, participants will be able to: Determine when and how to use coaching questions to support others development and performance, Facilitate a coaching conversation in 10 minutes or less, Effectively establish a new habit",Workday
Meaningful Feedback,"Feedback is a catalyst for career growth and can be a really positive experience. People generally want to know how they’re doing and what they can improve on.

Ladder of Inference & The Drama Triangle,"What you say and how you say it is a part of what makes communication effective, but it's not the whole story. The assumptions you make about your exchanges with others (both verbally and non-verbally), and what roles you assume in those exchanges also plays a big role in your communication.​",Workday
Listening with Purpose,"""Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply."" -Stephen Covey. For most of us in the consulting business, our role is often to share our knowledge and expertise with others, but that doesn't make for a great listening experience when we're engaging in conversation with our clients. To truly deliver great work, we must first understand our clients, then work to help them solve their problems. In this interactive experience, we're going to flip the page from expert to listener by exploring the impact of being listened to, understanding some of our default listening behaviors, and developing the ability to focus our attention on how our clients and colleagues need us to listen.",Workday

"Cloud Computing Applications, Part 2: Big Data and Applications in the Cloud","Welcome to the Cloud Computing Applications course, the second part of a two-course series designed to give you a comprehensive view on the world of Cloud Computing and Big Data! In this second course we continue Cloud Computing Applications by exploring how the Cloud opens up data analytics of huge volumes of data that are static or streamed at high velocity and represent an enormous variety of information. Cloud applications and data analytics represent a disruptive change in the ways that society is informed by, and uses information.

We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.,Coursera
Reproducible Research,"This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.",Coursera
Statistical Inference,"Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, …) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.",Coursera

Ruby on Rails: An Introduction,"Did you ever want to build a web application?  Perhaps you even started down that path in a language like Java or C#, when you realized that there was so much “climbing the mountain” that you had to do? Maybe you have heard about web services being all the rage, but thought they were too complicated to integrate into your web application. Or maybe you wondered how deploying web applications to the cloud works, but there was too much to set up just to get going. In this course, we will explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping.  Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the “cloud” using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service). Best of all, it will almost feel effortless… Really! “But wait”, you will say, “there is no way that we can build a useful application if there is no database involved. You need the data for an application to be useful.” Great point! But what if… instead of getting the data from the database, we get it from the internet by tapping into one of the web services out there that readily provides data needed by our application? “Ok, but that’s probably very complicated”, you will say. Take this course and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how easy it is!",Coursera
